# DSH WorkBuddy Connect

English | [中文](./README.md)

Brings every model in the WorkBuddy desktop app (GLM-5.3, GLM-5.2, DeepSeek-V4-Pro, DeepSeek-V4-Flash, Kimi-K3, MiniMax-M3, Hy3, and more) straight into [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) — zero configuration in the DSH chat.

## Features

- **Works out of the box**: install and enable the plugin, then use it directly in DSH — no extra configuration.

- **Image input**: image messages are admitted per the upstream's per-model capability flag — most models (GLM-5.3-Flash, GLM-5.2, the DeepSeek-V4 series, etc.) accept pasted or dragged-in images, while text-only models (e.g. GLM-5.1) keep a clear refusal.

- **Thinking effort**: the model picker exposes the per-model effort levels the upstream declares (e.g. GLM-5.3 offers low / high / xhigh, GLM-5.3-Flash low / high / max), forwarded as `reasoning_effort` on the wire.

- **Limited-time free at a glance**: the status card marks models that are currently free / limited-time free / on a night discount (following the upstream `credits` and `tags` live).

- **Rate ratio at a glance**: every model in the selection list carries its credits multiplier on the name (e.g. `GLM-5.2 · x0.79`, `Hy3 · x0.00`), in both the `/model` popup and the composer seat; the status card adds a localized rate line too. The rate is display-only — requests always use the model id.

- **Info at a glance**: Settings → Plugins → DSH WorkBuddy Connect card

## Install

Prerequisite: the WorkBuddy desktop app is installed and signed in (the plugin reuses the app's sign-in state and follows account switches automatically).

The plugin runs under all three DSH interfaces: **Web**, **Desktop**, and **TUI**. Pick the install command that matches the profile you use.

```sh
# Web (recommended; ships prebuilt artifacts)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-workbuddy-connect
dsh web

# or install the Web version from the GitHub source
dsh plugin --profile web add github:corrinehu/dsh-workbuddy-connect
dsh web
```

> Release lines: builds that track the dsh alpha series carry an `-alpha.N` suffix and are published under the `alpha` dist-tag (never `latest`). The default install resolves the stable line; when you run an alpha dsh, install the alpha line instead:
>
> ```sh
> dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-workbuddy-connect@alpha
> ```

```sh
# Desktop (the DSH Desktop app)
dsh plugin --profile desktop add dsh-workbuddy-connect
dsh --profile desktop
```

```sh
# TUI (terminal UI)
dsh plugin --profile dsh-tui add dsh-workbuddy-connect
dsh --profile dsh-tui
```

> Note: the `dsh-tui` profile requires pnpm 11 to install packages (a different pnpm on PATH fails with `ERR_PNPM_UNEXPECTED_STORE` — use `npx pnpm@11`); verified on dsh `0.1.2-alpha.3`.

After installing, switch to a WorkBuddy model in the model picker of the interface you chose. On Web, the settings card (Settings → Plugins → DSH WorkBuddy Connect) shows the account, token validity, and remaining credit; on TUI, configure `authFile` in `/settings`.

## CLI

`dsh plugin --profile <web|desktop|dsh-tui> exec dsh-workbuddy-connect status`: sign-in state and remaining credit (`--json` for machine-readable output; `doctor` for diagnostics and `logout` for credential cleanup are also available).

## Known limitations

- Verified on macOS with the DSH Web / Desktop / TUI profile (`0.1.2-alpha.3`+, Node 22+). Windows probes Local and Roaming AppData in order; WSL first reads credentials from the mounted Windows user profile. If the Windows and Linux user names differ and Windows environment variables are not forwarded into WSL, point `WORKBUDDY_AUTH_FILE` at the actual file.
- Relies on WorkBuddy client interfaces (not a public API); the plugin may need updates as WorkBuddy changes.
